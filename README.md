## Required Libraries

Assuming you have Node installed, you simply have to run `npm install` under the `src/frontend`, `src/backend` and `src/bootstrap` folders.

## How to run

Run `npm start` under the components you want to run. If you want to run all of them, use `src/frontend`, `src/backend` and `src/bootstrap` folders.

### Backend

Peers of the application, accompanied by a REST API so it can communicate with the frontend.

### Frontend

Interface of the application, where the user can interact with a node.

### Bootstrap

Nodes that are responsible for the initial connection of the network and for helping nodes discovering new peers.
